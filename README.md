# Tree - Chart

Small tree chart widget that can be used as component in other projects.

## Usage

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Done

- Components styling for main view (without much style for rwd),
- components functionality,
- widget works - you can add and delete elements and subelements to the tree,
- state management with Context and Hooks

## What I've learned

- Basics of atomic design architecture,
- better project setup for react,

## What's more that could've been done / to be done

- Better props passing - right now there is too much props drilling,
- more effective components,
- rwd,
- think about bigger app that can use this widget and refactor state management into redux.
